# particle-collision

This project is for the course "Numerische Modellierung von Mehrphasenströmungen" offered by 
Department of Fluid Mechanics (Institute für Strömungsmechanik) at TU Dresden. 

The collision is modelled using Soft-Sphere approach a.k.a Discrete Element Method.

This branch contains the overlap of the particles
